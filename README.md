# Google Translate Focus Input On Type

A Violentmonkey script for focus input area on type for Google Translate

Note: it does not work for Tampermonkey because of match pattern, but feel free to change it (`translate.google.tld`) to `translate.google.com` or which ever top level domain suits you then install to Tampermonkey
